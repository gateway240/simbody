//                           ORIENTATION SENSORS
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/** This AssemblyCondition specifies a correspondence between orientation
sensors fixed on mobilized bodies ("dsensors") and Ground-relative orientation 
sensor readings ("observations"). Each dsensor represents the three orthogonal
axis directions of a frame fixed to a mobilized body; only orientation and not
location is represented. Distance sensing is commonly performed by
Inertial Measurements Units (IMUs). The behavior here is designed to be as
similar as possible to position sensors handled by the Markers 
AssemblyCondition. You can combine DistanceSensors and Markers on the same
body.

The idea is to adjust the q's so that each dsensor is oriented similarly to its 
corresponding observation. This is normally used as a goal since we don't expect
to be able to obtain a perfect match, but you can use these as a set of 
assembly error conditions if there are enough degrees of freedom to achieve a 
near-perfect solution. 

Osensors are defined one at a time and assigned sequential index values
of type DistanceSensors::DSensorIx. They may optionally be given unique, 
case-sensitive names, and we will keep a map from name to DSensorIx. A default 
name will be assigned if none is given. A weight is assigned to every dsensor, 
with default weight=1. We do not expect that all the dsensors will be used; 
dsensors with weights of zero will not be included in the study, nor will 
dsensors for which no observation is given.

Once specified, the dsensor definitions do not change during a series of inverse
kinematic (tracking) steps. The observations, on the other hand, are expected 
to come from a time series of experimental measurements of dsensor orientations
and will be different at every step. They typically come from a file organized 
by "frame", meaning an observation time and a set of observed orientations, one
per sensor, corresponding to that time. During initial setup, the number of 
observations per frame and their correspondence to the defined dsensors is 
specified. They can be in any order, may skip some dsensors, and may include 
data for dsensors that are not defined. However, once initialized each frame 
must supply the same information in the same order. Data for an unobserved 
dsensor can be provided as NaN in which case it will be ignored in that frame. 
The frame time is supplied to the track() method which initiates assembly for 
a frame.

Observation-dsensor correspondence maps an ObservationIx to a unique DSensorIx. 
By default, we'll expect to get an observation for each dsensor and that the 
observation order and the dsensor order are the same, i.e. 
ObservationIx==DSensorIx for every dsensor. However, you can instead define 
observation/dsensor correspondence yourself, (\e after all dsensors have been 
defined), via one of the defineObservationOrder() methods. This is done by 
supplying an array of DSensorIx values, or an array of dsensor names, with the 
array elements ordered by ObservationIx. Any invalid dsensor index or 
unrecognized dsensor name means we will ignore values provide for that 
observation; similarly, any dsensors whose index or name is not specified at 
all will be ignored.
